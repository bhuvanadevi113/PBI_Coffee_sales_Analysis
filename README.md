# PBI_Coffee_sales_Analysis

For a few months, I want to examine the sales at coffee shops. After receiving a dataset as an Excel file, I used Power Query to perform some data cleanup and produce the dashboard that is displayed below.

 ##  1. Peak Sales Analysis
 Weekdays (74.41% of sales): The majority of sales occur during weekdays, indicating strong demand from a working crowd.\
 Recommendation: Focus promotions or loyalty programs for weekday customers.
 
 Time Analysis: Sales peak between 9 AM and 1 PM, likely due to breakfast and lunchtime traffic.\
 Recommendation: Optimize staffing and inventory during these hours.

## 2. Product Performance

Top Products: Coffee, tea, and bakery items dominate the sales mix.Coffee alone accounts for 38% of total sales ($60.36K).\
High growth categories: Brewed herbal tea (+35.8%) and brewed black tea (+34.3%).

Low-performing products: Packaged chocolate ($0.98K) and branded items ($2.89K).\
Recommendation: Reassess the inventory or marketing approach for these items, potentially bundling them with bestsellers.

## 3. Store Performance

Hell's Kitchen: Top-performing location ($52.60K) with a 30.5% growth vs. last month.\
Astoria and Lower Manhattan follow closely with similar growth rates (~32%).\
Recommendation: Leverage Hell’s Kitchen’s popularity by introducing localized offers or events.

## 4. Seasonal and Promotional Opportunities

High Weekend Sales Share (25.59%): Although smaller than weekday sales, the weekend still shows significant volume ($40K).\
Recommendation: Introduce weekend specials, e.g., family packs or discounts to boost traffic.

## 5. Custom Marketing Ideas

Use the Sales by Day and Hour heatmap to run time-based campaigns:\
Offer early-bird discounts (6-9 AM) to increase morning traffic.\
Launch lunchtime combo offers (11 AM - 1 PM) to capitalize on peak demand.
