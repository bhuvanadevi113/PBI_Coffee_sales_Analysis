# SQL and PBI_Coffee_sales_Analysis

For a few months, I want to examine the sales at coffee shops. After receiving a dataset as an Excel file, I used Power Query to perform some data cleanup and produce the dashboard that is displayed below. Also,i have uploaded these data into mysql and analysed it by using window function,joins and subqueries.

 ##  1. Peak Sales Analysis
 Weekdays (74.41% of sales): The majority of sales occur during weekdays, indicating strong demand from a working crowd.\
 Recommendation: Focus promotions or loyalty programs for weekday customers.
 
 Time Analysis: Sales peak between 9 AM and 1 PM, likely due to breakfast and lunchtime traffic.\
 Recommendation: Optimize staffing and inventory during these hours.

## 2. Product Performance

Top Products: Coffee, tea, and bakery items dominate the sales mix.Coffee alone accounts for 38% of total sales ($60.36K).\
High growth categories: Brewed herbal tea (+35.8%) and brewed black tea (+34.3%).

Low-performing products: Packaged chocolate ($0.98K) and branded items ($2.89K).\
Recommendation: Reassess the inventory or marketing approach for these items, potentially bundling them with bestsellers.

## 3. Store Performance

Hell's Kitchen: Top-performing location ($52.60K) with a 30.5% growth vs. last month.\
Astoria and Lower Manhattan follow closely with similar growth rates (~32%).\
Recommendation: Leverage Hell’s Kitchen’s popularity by introducing localized offers or events.

## 4. Seasonal and Promotional Opportunities

High Weekend Sales Share (25.59%): Although smaller than weekday sales, the weekend still shows significant volume ($40K).\
Recommendation: Introduce weekend specials, e.g., family packs or discounts to boost traffic.

## 5. Custom Marketing Ideas

Use the Sales by Day and Hour heatmap to run time-based campaigns:\
Offer early-bird discounts (6-9 AM) to increase morning traffic.\
Launch lunchtime combo offers (11 AM - 1 PM) to capitalize on peak demand.
